# Tasks 

## Mandatory Tasks
0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life

1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't

## Advanced Tasks
2. With a face like mine, I do better in print

3. What one has not experienced, one will never understand in print

4. Nothing in fine print is ever good news

5. My weakness is wearing too much leopard print

6. How is the world ruled and led to war? Diplomats lie to journalists and believe these lies when they see them in print
